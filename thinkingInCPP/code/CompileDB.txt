# Compiler information listings for Thinking in 
# C++ 2nd Edition By Bruce Eckel. See copyright 
# notice in Copyright.txt.
# This is used by ExtractCode.cpp to generate the
# makefiles for the book, including the command-
# line flags for each vendor's compiler and 
# linker. Following that are the code listings 
# from the book that will not compile for each 
# compiler. The listings are, to the best of my 
# knowledge, correct Standard C++ (According to 
# the Final Draft International Standard). Please
# note that the tests were performed with the 
# most recent compiler that I had at the time, 
# and may have changed since this file was 
# created.
# After ExtractCode.cpp creates the makefiles
# for each chapter subdirectory, you can say 
# "make egcs", for example, and all the programs
# that will successfully compile with egcs will
# be built.
